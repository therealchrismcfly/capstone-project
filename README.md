# Pump it UP üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## About
I've always been looking for a lean and structured way to plan my workouts. That's why I chose to create this fitness app as my final project for the Web Development Bootcamp at neuefische. Pump it UP helps you to create your individual workout plan for each day. You can choose from a list of exercises and save your favorite ones. Furthermore you can enter workout details such as reps, sets and weight for each exercise and track you progress in the progress history.
